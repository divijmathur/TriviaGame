# TriviaGame

Created a Friends Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. There are 10 questions that are randomly generated with a countdown timer for  the answer. It gives the correct answer after the user's guess. After 10 questions, it will display the score with the option to restart the game.
